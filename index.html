                    <h3>Cat Tail Language</h3>
                    <p>
                        A cat’s tail is one of the first places to look for signs of their mood:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>High, vertical tail: Confident, comfortable, happy, and friendly.</li>
                        <li>Low tail: Fearful or anxious.</li>
                        <li>Tucked tail: A fearful cat making itself appear smaller to avoid confrontation.</li>
                        <li>High, puffed-out tail: A cat trying to look larger to intimidate potential threats.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        It's important to observe how the shape of the cat's tail relates to its overall posture and the
                        surrounding situation.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <img src="img/cat-ear.png" alt="Cat Ear" title="Cat Ear" width="150" height="150">
                </div>
                <div class="activity-column">
                    <h3>Cat Ear Language</h3>
                    <p>
                        A cat’s ears are another significant indicator of its mood:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Forward-facing ears: The cat is attentive, curious, or playful.</li>
                        <li>Flattened ears: The cat is frightened, defensive, or aggressive.</li>
                        <li>Swiveling ears: The cat is uncertain or hearing something unfamiliar.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Just like the tail, the ears' position offers insight into how a cat is reacting to its
                        environment.

                    <h3>Cat Eye Language</h3>
                    <p>
                        A cat’s posture, tail, and ears will give a lot of clues, but the eyes can also reveal much:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Slow blinking: A sign of trust and comfort. If your cat is blinking slowly at you, it's a
                            good
                            indication that it feels safe.
                        </li>
                        <li>Dilated pupils: A sign of stimulation, which can mean excitement, fear, or playfulness.
                            Context
                            is key in determining which emotion the cat is experiencing.
                        </li>
                        <li>Narrowed pupils: Often indicates focus, relaxation, or readiness to engage in hunting
                            behavior.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        The eyes add more context to the cat’s emotional state when combined with other body language
                        signs.
                    </p>

                <h2>Sound Understanding</h2>
            </div>
            <p>While not technically "body language," a cat’s vocalizations are a crucial part of understanding their
                emotions.
            </p>

                <h3>Why do cats purr?</h3>
                <p>
                    Most people understand that purring is a good sign, but, in fact, like most other indicators, it’s
                    not guaranteed. Purring is a sign of pleasure – it’s the most obvious way to tell when a cat is
                    happy.
                    However, cats may also purr when they’re in pain! Many veterinarians report that cats purr when
                    they’re injured or
                    feeling sick.

                <h3>Why is my cat constantly meowing?</h3>
                <p>
                    Meowing can be tricky to interpret because it serves many purposes:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hunger: Your cat could be signaling it wants food.</li>
                    <li>Chatty nature: Some cats, especially certain breeds, are more vocal than others.</li>
                    <li>Discomfort: If meowing is persistent and your cat seems unwell, it’s time to visit the vet.</li>
                    <li>Constant meowing, in context with other behaviors, is essential to fully understanding what your
                        cat is trying to communicate.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Cat Fear/Aggresion Sounds</h3>
                <p>
                    When a cat wants you to understand that they’re feeling threatened, they may go through a series of
                    vocalizations, increasing in intensity as their discomfort increases.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>the growl: A growling cat is warning you to back off.</li>
                    <li>the hiss: Hissing indicates that a cat is feeling threatened and may be getting ready to fight
                        or flee; hissing is also a very effective way of showing a potential aggressor that the cat is
                        armed with
                        sharp fangs.</li>
                    <li>the yowl: usually comes after the hiss and is a loud rising vocalization. Cats also make this
                        sound when they're in heat.</li>
                    <li>the shriek: Finally, a cat that’s shrieking feels that they’re out of options and is about to
                        make their stand or retreat. </li>
                </ul>
