        <h2>Behavior Understanding</h2>

        <h3>Cat Tail Language</h3>
        <img src="img/cat-tail.png" alt="Cat Tail" title="Cat Tail">
        <p>
            A cat’s tail is one of the first places to look for signs of their mood:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>High, vertical tail: Confident, comfortable, happy, and friendly.</li>
            <li>Low tail: Fearful or anxious.</li>
            <li>Tucked tail: A fearful cat making itself appear smaller to avoid confrontation.</li>
            <li>High, puffed-out tail: A cat trying to look larger to intimidate potential threats.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            It's important to observe how the shape of the cat's tail relates to its overall posture and the surrounding situation.
        </p>

        <h3>Cat Ear Language</h3>
        <img src="img/cat-ear.png" alt="Cat Ear" title="Cat Ear">
        <p>
            A cat’s ears are another significant indicator of its mood:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Forward-facing ears: The cat is attentive, curious, or playful.</li>
            <li>Flattened ears: The cat is frightened, defensive, or aggressive.</li>
            <li>Swiveling ears: The cat is uncertain or hearing something unfamiliar.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Just like the tail, the ears' position offers insight into how a cat is reacting to its environment.
        </p>

        <h3>Cat Eye Language</h3>
        <img src="img/cat-eye.png" alt="Cat Eye" title="Cat Eye">
        <p>
            A cat’s posture, tail, and ears will give a lot of clues, but the eyes can also reveal much:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Slow blinking: A sign of trust and comfort. If your cat is blinking slowly at you, it's a good indication that it feels safe.
            </li>
            <li>Dilated pupils: A sign of stimulation, which can mean excitement, fear, or playfulness. Context is key in determining which emotion the cat is experiencing.
            </li>
            <li>Narrowed pupils: Often indicates focus, relaxation, or readiness to engage in hunting behavior.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The eyes add more context to the cat’s emotional state when combined with other body language signs.
        </p>

        <h2>Sound Understanding</h2>
        <p>While not technically "body language," a cat’s vocalizations are a crucial part of understanding their emotions.</p>

        <h3>Why do cats purr?</h3>
        <p>
            Most people understand that purring is a good sign, but, in fact, like most other indicators, it’s not guaranteed. Purring is a sign of pleasure – it’s the most obvious way to tell when a cat is happy. However, cats may also purr when they’re in pain! Many veterinarians report that cats purr when they’re injured or feeling sick.
        </p>

        <h3>Why is my cat constantly meowing?</h3>
        <p>
            Meowing can be tricky to interpret because it serves many purposes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Hunger: Your cat could be signaling it wants food.</li>
            <li>Chatty nature: Some cats, especially certain breeds, are more vocal than others.</li>
            <li>Discomfort: If meowing is persistent and your cat seems unwell, it’s time to visit the vet.</li>
            <li>Constant meowing, in context with other behaviors, is essential to fully understanding what your cat is trying to communicate.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Cat Fear/Aggresion Sounds</h3>
        <p>
            When a cat wants you to understand that they’re feeling threatened, they may go through a series of vocalizations, increasing in intensity as their discomfort increases.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>the growl: A growling cat is warning you to back off.</li>
            <li>the hiss:  Hissing indicates that a cat is feeling threatened and may be getting ready to fight or flee; hissing is also a very effective way of showing a potential aggressor that the cat is armed with sharp fangs.</li>
            <li>the yowl: usually comes after the hiss and is a loud rising vocalization. Cats also make this sound when they're in heat.</li>
            <li>the shriek: Finally, a cat that’s shrieking feels that they’re out of options and is about to make their stand or retreat. </li>
        </ul>
